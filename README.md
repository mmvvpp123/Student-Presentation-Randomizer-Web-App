# Student Presentation Randomizer Web App

This is a web app of [Student Presentation Randomizer](https://github.com/mmvvpp123/student-presentation-randomizer). 

This app is used to randomly assign 10-minute presentation slots depending on the number of students. The start time is where the counter starts from and the assignment is done through a Random object.

**How It Works**

This web app is made using Java Servlets and Tomcat servlet container. The index.jsp file is the main page and from there you can enter the details that it asks.

I've been reading [Murach's Java Servlets and JSP](https://www.amazon.com/Murachs-Java-Servlets-JSP-Murach/dp/1890774782/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=jsp&qid=1561408183&s=gateway&sr=8-1) to better understand JSP and servlets.
